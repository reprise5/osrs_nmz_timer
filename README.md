# osrs_nmz_timer
Reminds you every 82 or 165 seconds continuously to use a dose of prayer potions for the Nightmare Zone minigame in Old School Runescape.


The Nightmare Zone minigame in Old School RuneScape basically requires you to keep your [combat]prayer active to stay alive.  since NMZ is afk-able, it's easy to forget to refill your prayer points with prayer potions, to which you die earlier than you wanted to.  

This timer is designed to remind you to dose up, allows a 3 second grace time as you do so, and then start counting down again automatically, and continuously.  It will send out an audio alert as well as display a message that will tell you it's time to refill your points.

the window is set to "always on top", so it hovers over your game window.
